🫁 Lung Cancer Data Analysis
This project explores a lung cancer dataset to uncover patterns related to smoking, alcohol consumption, and other health indicators. The goal is to identify risk factors and patterns that could help in early detection or prevention strategies.

📌 Project Overview
The dataset is analyzed to:

Understand the correlation between lifestyle factors (like smoking and alcohol) and lung cancer.

Visualize the distribution of patients with and without lung cancer across key variables.

Generate insights into age, gender, and symptom-based groupings.


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation and transformation

Matplotlib – Visualization

(Add Seaborn if used later)

🔍 Key Analysis Steps
Loaded and previewed the dataset (head())

Cleaned binary values (1 → NO, 2 → YES)

Checked for null values and dataset structure

Analyzed relationships between:

Smoking vs Alcohol Consumption in cancer patients

Symptom-wise comparisons between sick and healthy individuals

📈 Sample Insights
A higher number of patients with both smoking and alcohol consumption history were diagnosed with lung cancer.

Demographic and lifestyle-based risk combinations were analyzed using grouped counts.

📊 Visualizations (recommended additions)
You can include plots like:

Bar plots comparing smoking & alcohol status with lung cancer cases

Pie chart for cancer distribution

Age distribution histograms

Gender-wise comparisons
